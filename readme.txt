BFS to fetch different MIME types of WebPages, following Robots Exclusion Protocols, parsing HTML/XML URL in Python.



I use Python 2.7.2 on win32 to do this assignment.

The Main program  is main.py.
Run Module(Ctr + F5) to run it.

You only need to input search-keywords and file's output path in main.py.
